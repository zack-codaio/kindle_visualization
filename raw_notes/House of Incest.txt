I looked with chameleon eyes upon the changing face of the world, looked with anonymous vision upon my uncompleted self.I awoke at dawn, thrown up on a rock, the skeleton of a ship choked in its own sails.She stared with such an ancient stare, heavy luxuriant centuries flickering in deep processions. From her nacreous skin perfumes spiraled like incense. Every gesture she made quickened the rhythm of the blood and aroused a beat chant like the beat of the heart of the desert, a chant which was the sound of her feet treading down into the blood the imprint of her face.The leaf fall of her words, the stained glass hues of her moods, the rust in her voice, the smoke in her mouth, her breath on my vision like human breath blinding a mirror.
