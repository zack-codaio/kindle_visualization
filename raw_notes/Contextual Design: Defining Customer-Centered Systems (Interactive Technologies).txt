The sequence model is most similar to flow diagrams or task analysis (Carter 1991), but is unique in stating the intent and trigger for the sequence.A sequence model starts with the overall intent of the sequence and the trigger that initiates it. Then it lists each step in order, at whatever level of detail the interviewer collected. Any steps that cause problems are labeled with a lightning bolt.An abstract step states the work done in each of the instances independently of the specifics of that instance.holes and design ideas.additional information and questions the reader would like answered.In pairs, people read through and talk about each work model in turn. They write issues on Post-its: key problems a design might address, constraints a design might account for, or a role the design should support (we will go into more detail about how to identify design issues using models in Chapter 18).
